This Machine Learning project is dedicated to accurately predicting blood donation rates. Its primary methodology centers on the application of Linear Regression (LR), which has exhibited superior performance compared to alternative models in terms of accuracy. Achieving an impressive accuracy score of 78%, LR serves as the foundation of this forecasting system. Furthermore, the project incorporates the utilization of the AutoML library EvalML to conduct thorough model evaluations, thereby enhancing the selection process for optimal predictive performance.
